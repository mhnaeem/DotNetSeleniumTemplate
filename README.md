# DotNetSeleniumTemplate

This repository contains a simple template that will allow users to quickly start writing tests in Selenium using .NET and C#.

The project is focused on developement in Visual Studio so loading the .sln file will allow you to quickly setup and run tests from inside Visual Studio.

I have also connected ExtentReports to the project so we can have good visual reporting with screenshots.
